## [0.7] vis version 0.7 - 2020-12-08

This is mostly a bug fix release with
[fixes for a few cases of undefined behavior](https://www.brain-dump.org/blog/finding-undefined-behavior-in-c-code/)
and preliminary work for experimentation with different
[core text management data structures](https://www.brain-dump.org/blog/rethinking-vis-text-management-data-structure/)

  target


## [0.5] vis version 0.5 - 2018-03-25

- Fix for a buffer overflow when dealing with invalid/incomplete
  Unicode sequences which caused an infinite loop/crash. With
  default compilation flags this should not be exploitable, but
  opening a malicious file would lose all unsaved changes.
- Fix color support in ncurses 6.1
- New default 256 color theme: zenburn. It should hopefully work
  better with the default color palette.
- Updated Docker based builds (`make docker`) to use latest
  Alpine Linux packages to produce a statically linked,
  self-contained binary.
- Take symbolic keys into account when evaluating key prefixes
  (`ci<` is not a prefix of `ci<Tab>`).
- Improved paragraph text objects.
- Reset count after handling ,
- Lexer updates for Clojure, Scheme, ASM, Pony, PHP, Python,
  Erlang, xs and ReasonML.
- Correct handling of `g/^$/` construct to match empty lines in
  commands like:

    x g/^$/ d

- `<C-v><Enter>` now inserts `\r` rather than `\n`, this
  currently also affects `r<Enter>` which might not be desirable.
- Fix command prompt malfunction triggered by special cursor position.
- Configure script can be interrupted.
- Removed `!` operator, use `:|`
- Ignore `SIGQUIT`
- `vis-open(1)` fixes


## [0.4] vis version 0.4 - 2017-07-23

- Selections as core editing primitives. Cursors have been superseded by singleton selections. Overlapping selections are now merged. This change is also reflected in the exposed Lua API (for which still no stability guarantee is given).

- Selections can be saved into marks on which set operations can be performed:

  `m` save selections\
  `M` restore selections\
  `|` set union\
  `&` set intersection\
  `\` set minus\
  `!` set complement\
  `z|` pairwise union\
  `z&` pairwise intersection\
  `z+` pairwise combine, choose longer\
  `z-` pairwise combine, choose shorter\
  `z<` pairwise combine, choose leftmost\
  `z>` pairwise combine, choose rightmost

  Marks are specified using `'{mark}` analogous to `"{register}`.

- Jump list based on marks:

  `g<` jump backward\
  `g>` jump forward\
  `gs` save currently active selections

- New register `#` to insert the current selection number.
- Drop special handling of `\r\n` line endings. `\r` will be
  displayed as `^M`. Enter will always insert `\n`.
- Fix Unicode regex search with libtre backend.
- New count specifiers for sam's `g` and `v` commands to
  keep/drop selections based on their index.
- On macOS saving files larger than INT_MAX bytes should work.
- New `:set show-eof` to toggle the display of end of file markers ~
  as before it is enabled by default.
- Double leading slashes of paths are stripped.
- Improved `:<` command implementation to only use a pipe when
  necessary.
- New lexers for Myrddin and `strace(1)`, updates for Elixir, Perl
  and Forth.
- Fix compilation for GNU Hurd. The vis package is now built for
  all supported Debian architectures.
- Improve job control of forked processes. SIGINT is now properly
  delivered to child processes.
- Commands given a huge count can now be interrupted using `.`
- This is implemented in cooperative fashion, meaning a single
  long running operation can still not be interrupted.
- More efficient line wise motions based on optimized
  `mem{r,}chr(3)` libc functions.
- Optionally support vim compatible n/N search direction.
- Reproducible, statically linked, self contained binary built
  using the Alpine Docker image. The idea being that it is a
  single file which can be copied to any Linux >= 2.6 system to
  provide a usable editor. It has an embedded tar archive which
  contains the required Lua support files which are extracted to
  a temporary directory using libuntar.
- Preliminary C API documentation found at: http://vis.rtfd.io
- Updated manual page.
- Various code cleanups.

Check the git log for further details.

## [0.3] vis version 0.3 - 2017-03-26

Most notable changes include:

- support for sam's structural regular expression based command language
- various bug fixes related to multiple cursor/selection support. New
  functionality to navigate among cursors (`<C-u>`, `<C-d>`), align
  (`<Tab>`, `<S-Tab>`), rotate (`+`, `-`), trim (`\`) or drop
  (`<C-c>`, `<C-l>`) selections.
- improved Lua API, featuring a new event subscription mechanism and the
  possibility to define custom operators, motions, text-objects, `:set`
  options and more. Notice however that at this point no API stability
  guarantee is provided.\
  You might have to update your `visrc.lua` configuration file, check the
  Documentation for details:
  http://martanne.github.io/vis/doc/
- new standalone tools vis-menu (`:o .`), vis-digraph (`<C-k>`) and
  vis-complete (`<C-k>`) for a simple file open dialog, digraph support
  and word completion, respectively.
- multiple bug fixes for vi(m) functionality, including improved count
  and repeat handling as well as better cursor positioning, `cw`, shift,
  join and autoindent implementation.
- new key mapping processing based on longest unique match
- optional libtre based regex backend for more memory efficient
  forward searches
- respect umask when creating new files, previously they were only
  read/writable by the current user. Also `fsync(2)` destination
  directory after `rename(2)` when performing an atomic save operation.
- new `:set` options to configure the used shell, escape
  delay, file save method and context to consider for syntax
  highlighting
- True color support in lexer themes, in case the terminal
  supports color palette changes
- minimal built-in `:help [pattern]` command
- incorporated upstream changes to LPeg based lexers used for syntax
  highlighting from the Scintillua project
- new set of manual pages in mdoc format
- experimental raw vt100 UI backend for resource constraint environments
- various code cleanups and bug fixes reported by static analysis, runtime
  interpretation and fuzzing tools
